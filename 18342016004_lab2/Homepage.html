                            It belongs to Picasso's period of distorted depictions, with its oversimplified outlines and
                            contrasted colors resembling early cubism.
                            The erotic content of the painting has been noted repeatedly, with critics pointing out that
                            Picasso painted an erect penis, presumably symbolizing his own, in the upturned face of his model.

                </td>
                <td>The canvas is of a suburban, placid Parisian riverside scene. Isolated figures, with their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with trees, austere boundary walls and buildings, and the River Seine are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.

                <td>The composition is organised around several axes, and incorporates the rules of neoclassicism. One axis is that which passes through the cross and has a vertical orientation. A diagonal line runs from the pope to the empress. All eyes are turned towards Napoleon, who is the center of the composition.
